    <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>

            Cheesy Crabmeat Canapes are an deliciously indulgent appetizer that can be made ahead
            for whenever you’re hosting company–or maybe just for you! I enjoyed these
            growing up and now you can enjoy them too.

        </p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

        <li>1 jar of Kraft Old English cheese</li>
        <li>7 ounces crabmeat</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon season salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>8 English muffins</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>

        <li>In medium bowl, combine ingredients–cheese through garlic salt.
            Place English muffin halves on baking sheet. Spread about 3 tablespoons cheese crab mixture on each half,
            dividing evenly as possible. Cut into quarter triangles. At this point you may freeze the canapes.
            Once they are frozen, you can remove them from the tray and store in a zip top bag or
            freezer safe container.</li>
        <li>To prepare, heat broiler on LOW. Place frozen canapes on baking sheet. Place under broiler for 5-7 minutes,
            checking after 5 minutes to make sure they do not burn. Heat until warmed through and cheese mixture
            is bubbly. If you would like them to be a little golden on top, switch broiler to HIGH and broil an
            additional 1-2 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>

        </ol>
